Digital marketing targeting refers to the process of selecting and focusing on specific segments of an audience that are most likely to be interested in your products, services, or messages. Instead of trying to reach a broad and general audience, targeting allows you to direct your marketing efforts towards individuals or groups who are more likely to engage with and respond positively to your marketing campaigns. This approach helps you use your resources more effectively and generate better results.

Digital marketing targeting is crucial because it allows you to deliver personalized and relevant content to the right people at the right time, increasing the chances of conversions and engagement. It minimizes wastage of resources on audiences that are unlikely to be interested in what you're offering. Through data analysis and insights, you can refine and adjust your targeting strategies over time to optimize your campaigns for better performance and higher return on investment.
